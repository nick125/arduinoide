If you want to contribute to the ArduinoIDE project, we request that you follow
our coding standards. 

Coding Standard for Python Source Files ---------------------------------------
	* All source files must have the header (See below)
	* Tabs (No Spaces!)
	* Classnames in CamelCase
	* All Classes/Functions MUST have Docstrings (except for __init__)
	* Comment your code, especially areas that are obscure. 

	* Put a blank line between the end of your docstrings and the beginning 
	  of your code
	* Put a blank line between the end of one function and the beginning of 
	  another
	* Separate "system" imports and our imports
	* Sort imports by module name length (if possible), ascending.
	* Keep "import ..." and "from ... import ..." statements separate (if 
	  possible)
